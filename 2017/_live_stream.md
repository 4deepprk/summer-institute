# Live Stream

For those unable to attend in Princeton, we will be live-streaming each day from approximately 9:00am to 5:30pm EST. Group exercises and some of the visiting speaker's lectures will not be live-streamed. Follow this link (https://mediacentrallive.princeton.edu) to join. At the moment, the live-stream will not work in Chrome. If paused, reload the page to rejoin the live-stream.  **Update: All videos have been posted to the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRV9I1xz2KwlgvLQ8OadKw).**
