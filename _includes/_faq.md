#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time.  For example, you can apply to SICSS-Princeton, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline.  However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Where do I submit recommendation letters?

If you have recommendation letters, add the email addresses for your two recommenders to your application in Fluxx; they will receive an email with instructions on how to submit. Applicants should not submit recommendation letters on their own. If one of your recommenders did not receive an email from Fluxx, have them check their spam folder; otherwise, contact us and we can help you troubleshoot the issue. Please be mindful of the application deadline when informing your recommenders about the submission process.

#### I'm having trouble creating an account on Fluxx to submit my application.

If you are applying to the Duke or Princeton sites, you will need to apply via the Fluxx system. If you are confused about some of the application fields (e.g. Organization EIN), please just input as much information as you can. Also note that the account creation process can take a couple of days; please plan to create an account on Fluxx well in advance of the application deadline.
