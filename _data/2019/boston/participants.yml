  bio: "Ariella is a doctoral student in Organizational Behavior at Harvard Business School where she studies behavioral design. Specifically, she is interested in how environments can be structured to reduce bias in the workplace, in educational settings, in the online context, and in many others. She is also interested in using big data methods, such as computational text analysis to understand ways of improving feedback-giving. Previously, Ariella worked for the Behavioural Insights Team in London, where she applied findings from behavioral science to public policy. She has focused on delivering policy advice and designing and implementing field experiments related to sustainable transportation, criminal justice, and organizational behavior. Ariella graduated from Yale University with a BA in Ethics, Politics, and Economics."

- name: Melodie Yunju Song
  image: /2019/boston/images/msong.jpg
  bio: "Melodie Yunju Song is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Social Media Lab, Ryerson University. She received her PhD in Health Policy from McMaster University, Canada, where she was a graduate fellow at the Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship. Her dissertation looked into the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy on Twitter and how decision-makers are making sense of social media to inform immunization policymaking. Her academic interests intersect public health communication (esp. vaccine-preventable diseases, substance abuse and misuse, mental health), evidence-informed policy making, and the role of emerging technologies (such as social media) to inform the former two. Melodie received a graduate certificate in Global Health from the University of Washington, an MSc in public health policy and management, and a BSN from the National Taiwan University, Taiwan."
