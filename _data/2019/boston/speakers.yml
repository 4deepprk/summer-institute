    bio: "I am an economist who studies digitization and search and matching markets. I've written papers on topics such as the design of Airbnb’s search and matching algorithm, reputation systems, online job search, and 401(k) contribution choices by workers. I am currently an assistant professor of marketing at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. My research has been published in both economics journals (American Economic Review, The Review of Economics and Statistics) and computer science conferences (ACM-EC). I've provided expert input about the digital economy at the President’s Council on Science and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission. Prior to BU, I was a postdoc at the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT. I worked as a data scientist at Airbnb while completing a Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University. In my free time, I climb, write, and make a podcast."

  bio: "I am a computational social scientist in the Management of Organizations group at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. My current research interests are around structure, governance, and inequality in sociotechnical systems; measurement and social networks; and the social structure of the opioid epidemic. I am currently a postdoc with Toby Stuart and Mathijs de Vaan at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, where I am also a member of the Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group. I hold a PhD in Computer Science, which focused on computational tools for understanding social networks, advised by Aaron Clauset at the University of Colorado Boulder. During my PhD I was fortunate to spend time at Microsoft Research NYC, mentored by Duncan Watts (intern 2015, 2016 & consulting researcher, 2015-2017), and to have funding from an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. In 2015, I served as an organizer for the Women in Machine Learning Workshop, a technical workshop co-located with NIPS, and as of 2018 I am on the Board of Directors for Women in Machine Learning. I previously received a BA in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences and Mathematics from Northwestern University."

- name: In Song Kim
  image: /2019/boston/images/ikim.jpg
  bio: "In Song Kim is an Associate Professor of Political Science. He holds a Ph.D. in Politics from Princeton University, where he received a Harold W. Dodds Fellowship for 2012-2013. His dissertation research on the effects of firms’ lobbying on trade policy-making received the 2015 Mancur Olson Award for the Best Dissertation in Political Economy. Professor Kim works at the intersection of statistical machine learning and political science. His research explores trade policies of various countries in the world on highly specific products, and political activities of firms that produce and trade goods internationally. He is also interested in developing statistical methods for causal inference with panel data, and text analysis for analyzing political documents."

- name: Jacqueline Ng Lane
  image: /2019/boston/images/jlane.jpg
  bio: "Jacqueline Ng Lane is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard Business School at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH).  Her research integrates insights from organizational theory, technology adoption, team effectiveness, and social networks to better understand how companies can implement new technologies to more effectively collaborate, share knowledge and improve organizational outcomes. A second avenue of her research examines people’s socio-technical motivations for forming, maintain, and dissolving collaborative ties with others, particularly when organizing into interdisciplinary or diverse teams. She holds a PhD in Management Sciences from Northwestern University, where she was a member of the Science of Networks in Communities (SONIC) lab and Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO). Before her PhD, Jacqueline worked in sales & trading, equity research, and customer relationship management. She earned an executive MBA from Columbia University and a B.S.E in Operations Research & Financial Engineering from Princeton University."

- name: Laura K. Nelson
  image: /2019/boston/images/lnelson.jpg
  bio: "Laura K. Nelson is a sociologist who uses computational methods to study social movements, culture, gender, institutions, and the history of feminism. Using computer-assisted texts analysis and network analysis, her dissertation examined the political logics underlying women’s movements in New York City and Chicago from 1865-1975. She is interested in further developing automated text analysis methods and best-practices for sociology and digital humanities. She received her Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley. In 2014-2016 she was a postdoc in Management and Organizations in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and is on leave this year as a fellow for Digital Humanities @ Berkeley and the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley."

- name: Brooke Foucault Welles
  image: /2019/boston/images/bwelles.jpg
  bio: "Brooke Foucault Welles is an Associate Professor in the department of Communication Studies and core faculty of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. Combining the methods of network science with theories from the social sciences, Foucault Welles studies how online communication networks enable and constrain behavior, with particular emphasis on how these networks facilitate the pursuit of individual, team, and collective goals. Much of her work is interdisciplinary and collaborative, with co-authors from computer science, political science, digital humanities, design, and public health. Her recent contributions include a series of studies of the transformative power of networked counterpublics, techniques for the longitudinal analysis of communication networks using event-based network analysis, and guidelines for the effective use of network visualizations in scientific and lay publications. Her work is funded by grants from the US Army Research Office and US Army Research Lab, and has been featured in leading social science journals such as the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication and Society, and The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. She serves on the editorial board of the journal Web Science and was part of the team that developed the Network Literacy Essential Concepts and Core Ideas."

- name: Jinhua Zhao
  image: /2019/boston/images/jzhao.jpg
  bio: "Jinhua Zhao is the Edward and Joyce Linde Associate Professor of City and Transportation Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Prof. Zhao brings behavioral science and transportation technology together to shape travel behavior, design mobility system and reform urban policies. He develops methods to sense, predict, nudge and regulate travel behavior; designs multimodal mobility system that integrates autonomous vehicles, shared mobility and public transport; and reform urban policies to govern the new technologies and business models. Prof. Zhao sees transportation as a language to describe a person, to characterize a city, and to understand an institution. Prof. Zhao leads long-term research collaborations with major transportation authorities and operators worldwide including London, Chicago, Hong Kong and Singapore. He holds Master of Science, Master of City Planning and Ph.D. degrees from MIT and a Bachelor's degree from Tongji University. Prof. Zhao directs the Urban Mobility Lab (mobility.mit.edu) at MIT and is the founder of the MIT Automated Mobility Policy Project."
