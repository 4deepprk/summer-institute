Her research interests lie in the intersection of political sociology, social movements, and studies on social inequalities. In her book project, she conducts a comparative analysis of higher education policies and the protests against tuition hikes over the last two decades in 34 OECD countries with a special focus on England, Germany, Turkey, and the United States. She has been interested in the computational methods within the context of analyzing the media coverage of social movements and the formation of political discourse through social media use. She is in the process of developing her next project, which analyzes the effectiveness of social movement alliances in influencing policy outcomes during significant transformations in the political structures. This study will also use a mixed methods approach that combines computational methods with qualitative comparative methods, and quantitative analysis of survey data. Before UNC, she received BA degrees in political science& international relations and history, as well as an MA degree in modern Turkish history, from Boğaziçi University."
