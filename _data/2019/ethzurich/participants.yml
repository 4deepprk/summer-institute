  bio: "Alessandra Stampi-Bombelli is a Research Assistant at University of Zurich’s Chair of Political Economy of Development. She received a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Roma Tre and a M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Lausanne in 2017. This summer she will be starting a PhD at ETH Zurich, jointly with the Center for Law & Economics, the Public Policy Group and the Immigration Policy Lab. Her PhD will focus broadly on applying machine learning techniques to topics of empirical economics and policy and, in particular, on migration. She is currently working on a project that assesses the effect of immigrant group size on integration during the period of Mass Migration in the US. Her research interests include migration economics and policy, identity and integration, and behavioral development economics."

  bio: "Kieran Mepham is a PhD student in the Social Networks Lab at ETH Zürich, with a BSc in social psychology and MSc in interdisciplinary social science from Utrecht University. His research interests include the development of culture, group formation, and opinion polarization, focusing on the micro-macro perspectives of these issues in networks. He currently explores these topics using traditional and novel data-gathering and analytic methods."

- name:  Arto Kekkonen
  image: /2019/ethzurich/images/Arto_Kekkonen.jpg
  bio: "Arto Kekkonen is a doctoral candidate at the University of Helsinki's Faculty of Social Sciences. He is currently researching the relationship between political polarization and social media, with a specific focus on affective polarization and ingroup-outgroup dynamics. Arto has a background in media and communication studies and computer science and is broadly interested in how computational methods could be better used to answer theoretically interesting questions in social sciences."

- name:  Germain Gauthier
