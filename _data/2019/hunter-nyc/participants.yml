- name: Brandon Kramer
  bio: "Brandon L. Kramer (PhD, Rutgers University) is a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Virginia's 
  Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative (starting July 2019). Drawing from insights at the intersection of medical sociology, 
  science & technology studies and computational social science, Brandon studies how assumptions about race, gender and 
  sexuality become imbued into biomedical research. In his dissertation, he examined the racialization of testosterone in 
  scientific research and the impact that this has had on the construction of racial disparities in prostate cancer. 
  Brandon incorporates a range of methods, including content analysis, experiments, biosocial methods, computational text 
  analysis, and social network analysis."

- name: Hannah Szlyk
  bio: "Hannah is currently a NIMH T32 postdoctoral research scholar at The Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis.
  Hannah earned her doctoral degree in social work at the Steve Hicks School of Social Work at the University of Texas at 
  Austin in May 2018. There, Hannah studied suicidality among minority and underserved youth. Her dissertation consisted of
  a mixed methods project that examined suicidal ideation, sexual and ethnic identity, external stressors, and academic 
  progress among students attending a public alternative high school. Hannah is currently exploring the evidence base and 
  implementation of technology-enhanced interventions for youth suicidality. She is specifically interested in understanding 
  who uses text-based message hotlines to address suicidality and how these crisis interventions can be better adapted for 
  hard-to-reach and minority youth populations. Hannah would also like to gain skills in computational science in order to 
  analyze large-scale datasets and hotline conversations. Hannah enjoys practicing yoga, traveling, and spending time with 
  her partner and their four cats."

  using social psychological research to inform policy and practice within organizations—for example, her dissertation 
  research investigates how sex discrimination policy can impact women’s perceptions of organizational climate, motivation, 
  and achievement. In her free time, Maya likes running around Prospect Park, doing/attempting the NYTimes Crossword, and 
  reading."

  bio: "Salar Khaleghzadegan is pursuing a Master of Public Policy with a concentration in Health Policy at the University 
  of Maryland Baltimore County and is a Research Coordinator at the Johns Hopkins Medicine Armstrong Institute for Patient 
  Safety and Quality. He is currently exploring research focused on understanding how to improve equitable access, quality, 
  and outcomes of care with an emphasis on maintaining cost-effectiveness through high-value care. One of his current 
  projects uses textual analysis to examine healthcare documents using NLP methods. Another project studies the linguistic 
  and paralinguistic features of patient-provider communication to assess how these dynamic interactions drive outcomes 
  (i.e. compliance with complex care regiments; patient experiences of respect, dignity, and satisfaction with care). 
  This fall, he will be applying to doctoral programs in Health Policy and Management, where he hopes to focus on health 
  services research while integrating emerging quantitative and computational methods such as machine learning, 
  causal inference, and automated text analysis."
