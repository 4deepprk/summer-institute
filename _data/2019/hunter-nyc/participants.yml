- name: Brandon Kramer
  bio: "Brandon L. Kramer (PhD, Rutgers University) is a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Virginia's 
  Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative (starting July 2019). Drawing from insights at the intersection of medical sociology, 
  science & technology studies and computational social science, Brandon studies how assumptions about race, gender and 
  sexuality become imbued into biomedical research. In his dissertation, he examined the racialization of testosterone in 
  scientific research and the impact that this has had on the construction of racial disparities in prostate cancer. 
  Brandon incorporates a range of methods, including content analysis, experiments, biosocial methods, computational text 
  analysis, and social network analysis."

  bio: "Maya is going on her 5th year in the Basic and Applied Social Psychology PhD program at CUNY Graduate Center. 
  Maya’s research focuses around understanding, and intervening against, factors that contribute to disparities in the 
  representation and achievement of women in competitive contexts (e.g., leadership). She is particularly interested in 
  using social psychological research to inform policy and practice within organizations—for example, her dissertation 
  research investigates how sex discrimination policy can impact women’s perceptions of organizational climate, motivation, 
  and achievement. In her free time, Maya likes running around Prospect Park, doing/attempting the NYTimes Crossword, and 
  reading."

  bio: "Salar Khaleghzadegan is pursuing a Master of Public Policy with a concentration in Health Policy at the University 
  of Maryland Baltimore County and is a Research Coordinator at the Johns Hopkins Medicine Armstrong Institute for Patient 
  Safety and Quality. He is currently exploring research focused on understanding how to improve equitable access, quality, 
  and outcomes of care with an emphasis on maintaining cost-effectiveness through high-value care. One of his current 
  projects uses textual analysis to examine healthcare documents using NLP methods. Another project studies the linguistic 
  and paralinguistic features of patient-provider communication to assess how these dynamic interactions drive outcomes 
  (i.e. compliance with complex care regiments; patient experiences of respect, dignity, and satisfaction with care). 
  This fall, he will be applying to doctoral programs in Health Policy and Management, where he hopes to focus on health 
  services research while integrating emerging quantitative and computational methods such as machine learning, 
  causal inference, and automated text analysis."
