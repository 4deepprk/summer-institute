      bio: Ridhi Kashyap is associate professor of social demography and fellow of Nuffield College at the University of Oxford. She completed her DPhil in Sociology jointly affiliated with the University of Oxford and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. Her research spans a number of substantive areas in demography and sociology, including gender, mortality and health, the diversification of family forms, and ethnicity and migration. Her work has sought to adopt computational innovations both in terms of modelling approaches such as agent-based models and digital trace data from web and social media platforms to study social and demographic processes.  She is currently leading a Data2X and UN Foundation supported project that uses big data from the web, in particular large-scale online advertising data that provide information on the aggregate numbers of users of online platforms by demographic characteristics, to measure sustainable development and gender inequality indicators.

    - name: Ray Dutch
      image: /assets/images/DutchRyan.jpg
      bio: Ray is an Official Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, and the Director of the Nuffield Centre for Experimental Social Sciences (CESS), which has centres in Oxford (UK), Santiago (Chile), Tianjin (China) and Pune (India). Prior to assuming these positions, he was the Senator Don Henderson Scholar in Political Science at the University of Houston. He received his BA (Honours) from the University of Manitoba in Canada, and his MA and PhD from the University of Rochester. He is currently the Long-Term Visiting Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Toulouse School of Economics. Ray’s research utilizes experiments, digital trace and public opinion analysis to explain individual decision making. He has published extensively, including an award-winning book (The Economic Vote) on how economic outcomes affect democratic accountability. His work has appeared in forty leading journals in political science and economics. Ray’s current research agenda investigates the role of information acquisition in decision-making.  This includes: how individuals extract signals regarding the economic competence and responsibility of political actors; the interaction of financial literacy, fake news and investment behavior; and how to incorporate digital information acquisition into behavioral models.  He is also interested in the micro-foundations of lying and unethical behavior.  Ray explores these research questions through innovative experimental methods applied in labs, with diverse online subject pools, and as part of large-scale field experiments; experimental subjects are typically drawn from the CESS global network. In 2015, Ray was selected as a member of the UK Cabinet Office Cross-Whitehall Trial Advice Panel to assist Whitehall departments in designing and implementing experiments to assess policy effectiveness. He is a member of the Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) network.

      bio: "Roberto Cerina is a third-year DPhil candidate in Sociology at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, with an interest in Election Forecasting, Bayesian Statistics and non-representative surveys. His recent work has focused on making inference on electoral preferences from revealed behaviour on social-media; in particular, together with Professor Raymond Duch, he has forecasted the 2018 mid-term elections in Texas using likes from pages of public candidates on Facebook, leveraging the latest technology in prediction and post-stratification, and achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art surveys, at a fraction of the cost (see here from more: http://raymondduch.com/forecasts/). Currently he is working on forecasting the 2019 Indian Lok Sabha Elections using a convenience sample and Mechanical Turks. He is also working on finalising a Machine Learning pipeline to produce fully automated Opinion Polling from Twitter."
