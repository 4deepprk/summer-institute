- name: David Hagmann
  image: /assets/images/david-ha.jpg
  bio: David’s interests include information avoidance, behavioral interventions (nudges), and decisions from experience. In his dissertation, David studies persuasion in the presence of motivated reasoning. While we might think that changing someone’s mind is all about exposing them to facts that support our views and challenge theirs, such an approach may be more likely to engender defensive information avoidance rather than receptive information processing.
