# SICSS parter locations

You can host a partner location of Summer Institutes of Computational Social Science (SICSS) at your university, company, NGO, or government agency. As a university this is an exciting approach to providing training and building interdisciplinary community. As a company, NGO, or government agency, hosting a parter location enables building connections with the academic community, providing training for current employees, and recruiting future employees.

## Hosting a partner location

Starting in 2018, the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) began hosting partner locations in order to increase the number of people that could participate.  The Summer Institute is two weeks long, and involves: a) live streamed lectures on topics ranging from automated text analysis to ethics; b) training exercises to reinforce key ideas from lectures; c) live streamed research talks from leaders in the field; and d) participant-led group research projects.  This model has been used successfully at universities and companies around the world.

### Budget for a partner location

The Summer Institutes have been created in a highly modular fashion such that the open source curriculum can be adapted to the skills and interests at each location. The minimum budget to support a partner location is about $10,000 to $20,000 and depends on local conditions. If you want to support participants to travel to your partner locations costs will increase.  If you have more questions, please contact us at rsfcompsocsci[at]gmail[dot]com.

## Sponsoring a partner location

## Mission and guiding principles

The mission of the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science is to provide open, high-quality training in computational social science to researchers around the world in order to accelerate the growth of the field and ensure that it develops norms and standards that are in the long-term interests of science and society.

As we work toward this mission we will be guided by the following principles:

1. The training provided by SICSS will allows be free to participants.  

2. All materials that organizers develop will be released open source.

3. Funders and partner will have no impact on content.  

Achieving our goals will require us to work with funders and partners, but they will not impact the intellectual content of SICSS.  When in doubt about how to navigate this boundary, we will look to high-quality news organizations, such as the _New York Times_ and _National Public Radio_, for guidance.
