From the morning of June 15 to 26, 2020, Rutgers University will host a partner site for the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty. Most participant costs during the workshop, including lunch, will be covered, but participants will need to arrange for their own travel to and/or housing in New Brunswick, NJ. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science and those whose research focuses on social progress (broadly conceived). About twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. Preference will be given to participants from Rutgers and nearby institutions with a goal being to build a regional community of researchers interested in computational social science, but all applications will be given consideration.

Application materials are due March 30, 2020.
