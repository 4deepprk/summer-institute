### Eligibility
### <a name="eligibility"></a>

---

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty. About 20 participants will be invited. Preference will be given to applicants from Rutgers and nearby institutions in order to help build a regional community of computational social science researchers. However, all applications will be given consideration, and there are no formal restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. 

<br />
We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We are also especially interested in applicants whose research seeks to contribute to social progress (broadly conceived), particularly research related to the study of race, gender, sexuality, or systemic social and economic inequality.
<br />

<br />
We hope to assemble a diverse set of participants across many backgrounds and levels of expertise. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Applicants must submit the following documents here: https://forms.gle/b1EoxXHF9xYLypMV9: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science, (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. Applicants who are graduate students or postdoctoral researchers must submit one letter of recommendation from a faculty advisor. Letters of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science. All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number). All application materials must be submitted via email to sicssrutgers@gmail.com with the subject line "Recommendation for [APPLICANT NAME]."

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted before March 30, 2020.

Inquiries can be sent to sicssrutgers@gmail.com.
