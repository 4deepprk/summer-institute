### Hosting a partner location

Starting in 2018, the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) began including partner locations in order to increase the number of participants. The Summer Institute is two weeks long and parter locations typically involve: 1) live-streamed lectures on topics ranging from automated text analysis to ethics; 2) training exercises to reinforce key ideas from lectures; 3) live-streamed research talks from leaders in the field; and 4) participant-led group research projects. This model has been used successfully at universities and companies around the world.

The Summer Institutes are highly modular and the open source curriculum can be adapted to the skills and interests at each location. The minimum budget to support a partner location is about $15,000 but depends on local conditions. Here are some [sample budgets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_2BimdmWNLSVYqTmwrEZcQxv3j3LCyU0hQyW0vZYCk8/edit?usp=sharing). If you have more questions about budgeting—or grants that may be available to support partner locations—please contact us at rsfcompsocsci[at]gmail[dot]com.
            
In order to ensure quality and consistency, all partner locations must have a former participant of SICSS as one of the local organizers. If you don’t have any SICSS alumni at your organization, you can contact us about finding a former participant that could collaborate with you. For example, in 2019 Matti Nelimarkka (SICSS ‘17) collaborated with Akın Ünver to run a partner location in [Istanbul, Turkey](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/istanbul/)(Kadir Has University).
