From June 14 to June 27, 2020, [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) and [the University of California at Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) will host a partner event for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area. The San Francisco Bay Area Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (BAY-SICSS) has been generously supported by both Stanford University ([Institute for Research in the Social Sciences](https://iriss.stanford.edu/), [Human-Centered AI Initiative](https://hai.stanford.edu/), [Arts and Sciences](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/)) and UC Berkeley ([Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/), [Data-intensive Social Sciences Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/)), and [Hopelab](https://hopelab.org/).

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. In addition, BAY-SICSS is going to be unique among partner locations in its focus on community partnerships: during the second week, participants will co-develop a project with a local nonprofit.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program held at UC Berkeley.

Application materials are due XXXXXX, 2020.
