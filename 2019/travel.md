### Travel reimbursement policy

We are able to reimburse economy class transportation to and from the Summer Institute up to a set cap, which is based on the home institution of the participant.  The reimbursement caps are:

* East Coast US: $200
* North American, expect East Coast US: $500
* Outside of North America: $1,300

Participants who would like to be reimbursed for travel costs will need to submit an expense report, with receipts, after the Summer Institute is complete to Princeton University.  Due to funding limitations, we are only able to reimburse economy travel costs.  We are not able to reimburse for meals or other incidental expenses.

Inquiries can be sent to rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.
