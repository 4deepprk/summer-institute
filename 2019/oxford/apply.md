### ELIGIBILITY
We are inviting applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We are hoping to have wide participation from researchers across different departments and institutes within the University of Oxford, both from the social sciences and the computational/data sciences. We would also like to welcome a limited number of participants from other institutions both in the UK and abroad. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. 

### APPLICATION
Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages, double-spaced) describing your interest in computational social science and any relevant current research, (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. Letters of recommendation are not required for SICSS-Oxford. 

Please send all application materials (in one PDF file) to sicss.oxford@nuffield.ox.ac.uk at the latest by **Sunday, March 31, 2019, 11.59 pm (UK)**. Applicants will be notified about the outcome of their submission by end of April. 

Please note: applicants who have previously applied to other SICSS locations in 2019 **will need to reapply for SICSS-Oxford**. We have a separate application process. Also note that the SICSS-Oxford deadline is a month after the Princeton application deadline and after decisions about the main location are expected to have been made. If you have also applied to the Princeton location and other SICSS locations and have not yet heard from them at the time of your submission, please let us know in your cover letter. Applying to other SICSS locations will not affect your chances of being accepted to SICSS-Oxford.
