The Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) brings together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. SICSS is for both social scientists and data scientists.
In 2019, SICCS will be held from the evening of Sunday, June 16 to the morning of Saturday, June 29, 2019 at Princeton University. Because many more people are expected to apply than can be accommodated at Princeton, we are hosting a partner site at Oxford University (SICSS-Oxford). 
 
## DETAILS
SICSS-Oxford will run simultaneously to the Institute at Princeton: June 16 to June 29. It is organized by former participants of the 2017 and 2018 SICSS workshops and will feature local speakers and live streams from Princeton. In the afternoons of the first week, participants at the Oxford location will also be able to work in teams to learn how to implement the material from the lectures. In the second week, participants will form teams to develop a research project related to computational social science.


The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping and digital trace data, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
 
## COST & ACCOMMODATIONS
The Summer Institute in Computational Social Science is funded in part by grants from the Russell Sage Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. There are no registration fees for participating in SICSS-Oxford.
 
Participants are expected to attend both weeks of the institute. Meals will be provided for all participants at SICSS-Oxford during the event. Limited subsidies for accommodation and travel for those participants from outside Oxford may be available. 

## APPLICATION
A formal call for applications will be released in early March. See details for eligibility. The deadline for SICSS-Oxford applications will be **Friday, March 29, 2019.** Note that this is a month after the main application deadline and after decisions about the main location are expected to have been made. Applicants to SICSS-Oxford will be informed of decisions in early May. 

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science (especially as it relates to RSF research priorities such as behavioral economics, social inequality, future of work, and immigration), (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. Please **do not** submit letters of recommendation. If submitted, such letters will **not** be read or weighed in the acceptance process. 

Please note: applicants who have previously applied to other SICSS locations in 2019 will need to reapply for SICSS-Oxford.
