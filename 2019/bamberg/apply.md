# Eligibility

We invite applications from Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 5 years of their PhD. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. The Summer Institute will be held in English. We expect to invite about 20 to 30 participants for this partner location in Bamberg. 

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. We will provide additional readings in advance of the Institute that will help bring those with less exposure to social science research up to speed. Moreover, all participants will have access to DataCamp modules that provide an introduction to programming in R.

The aim of this partner location is to build and expand a network of computational social scientists in Germany. We invite applications not only from participants with a background in both computational methods and social science, but especially from those who seek to acquire new skills in either of these domains.

# How to Apply

To apply please visit: [https://goo.gl/forms/Sbftka8Gci65hn7L2](https://goo.gl/forms/Sbftka8Gci65hn7L2)

On this form, we ask that you provide some basic information about yourself and your academic background. To be considered, all applicants must submit the following documents in English language via the link above: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum two pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science, (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. 

Applicants who are Master students or PhD students must also submit one letter of recommendation from a faculty advisor. The letter of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science. All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g. phone number). We can offer support grants to cover housing and meal costs for a limited number of non-local participants, up to a set cap. Please indicate in your form whether you want to be considered for receiving a support grant.

In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be received by **Monday, February 25**. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail in mid-March, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. Inquiries can be sent to compsocsci.bamberg[at]gmail.com.
