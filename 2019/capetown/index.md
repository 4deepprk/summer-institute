A Summer Institute in Computational Social Science will be held at the University of Cape Town from 17-28 June 2019. The purpose of the Summer Institute in Cape Town is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The organizer and principal faculty of the Summer Institute in Cape Town is Dr Visseho Adjiwanou. It is supported by the University of Cape Town, Russel Sage Foundation, and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
 
The instructional program will involve lectures (mostly livestreamed from Princeton University), group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Since we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. All cost of participations (Ticket, accommodation, meals, registration) fees are all covered. 

About twenty five to thirty participants will be accepted. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/capetown/apply) should be received by Monday, February 25, 2019.

Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail in mid-March, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. Inquiries can be sent to [cssforafrica@gmail.com](maito:cssforafrica@gmail.com)
