# Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. All cost of participations (Ticket, accommodation, meals, registration) fees are all covered.


Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. All accepted students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute. You are encouraged from now to start learning R to increase your chance of acceptance.Your letter of presentation should demonstrate what you have done to improve your R skill abilities.
