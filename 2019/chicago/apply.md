# Eligibility

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Applicants are invited to apply from everywhere, but we cannot provide travel and lodging in Chicago. SICSS-Chicago is committed to diversity and inclusion in computational social science, and we welcome applicants from groups currently underrepresented in computational social science. About twenty applicants will be invited.


In advance of the institute, participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the institute.
