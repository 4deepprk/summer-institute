# Eligibility
We invite applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. We expect to invite about twenty participants for this partner location.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. We will provide additional readings in advance of the Institute that will help bring those with less exposure to social science research up to speed. Moreover, all participants will have access to DataCamp modules that provide an introduction to programming in R. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

The aim of this partner location is to build and expand a network of computational social scientists in the Boston area. We invite applications not only from participants with a background in both computational methods and social science, but especially from those who seek to acquire new skills in either of these domains.

# How to Apply
You can submit all documents online using [this Qualtrics survey](http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_87EtXSetX7plWiV).

Applicants are asked to submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science (especially as it relates to RSF research priorities such as behavioral economics, social inequality, future of work, and immigration), (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. Applicants who are graduate students are encouraged to submit a letter of recommendation from a faculty advisor.

If you wish to submit a letter of recommendation, please have it sent directly to <sicss.boston@gmail.com>.

In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by **11:59 PM PST on April 12th, 2019**. Note that this is six weeks after the main application deadline and after decisions about the main location are expected to have been made. If you have also applied to the Princeton location and have not yet heard from them at the time of your submission, please let us know in your cover letter.
