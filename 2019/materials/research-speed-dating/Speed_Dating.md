# **CHALLENGES OF GROUP PROJECTS**


Challenges
========================================================
&nbsp; 

1. Tremendous diversity of skills  
2. Ensuring good group chemistry 
3. Limited time 
4. Different goals?
5. Free-riding


SICSS Group Projects
========================================================
&nbsp; 

1. Can take on many forms (from original empirical research to creation of open-source tools)
2. In one week, many groups will only find enough time to create a proposal, though some may have pilot results by the end of the week.
3. Limited seed funding may be available at your site for pilot research and/or data purchasing, cloud computing costs.
4. Additional funding may be available at your site after the end of the week.

# **RESEARCH SPEED DATING**


Research Speed Dating

&nbsp;  

1. We crowdsource a list of research interests in a google sheet (5 min)
2. Each person enters a "1" under their research interests (5 min)
3. We identify maximally similar clusters of participants
4. We identify maximally different clusters of participants

Research Speed Dating
========================================================
&nbsp;  

1. Maximally similar clusters come up with a group project (30 min)  
2. Maximally different clusters come up with a group project (30 min)  
3. We start a new google doc. Each person takes 5 minutes to write down their favorite group project idea  
4. Everyone puts their name next to the group project they want to join  


Research Speed Dating
========================================================
&nbsp;  

1. Have lunch today with your group in order to begin discussing your project.  
2. It is ok to change groups until the end of today.



Timeline for this Week
========================================================
&nbsp;

Monday afternoon: refine group project idea  

Tuesday morning: write brief (<1 page) proposal 

Tuesday afternoon: the organizer of your site will begin responding to seed funding requests on a rolling basis (if funds are available)

Tuesday afternoon-Thursday night: work on group projects  

Friday (all day): group presentations (with feedback)


REQUIRED Deliverable
========================================================
&nbsp;

A document that contains a presentation of your group project that is between 10-20 minutes that explains:  

1) Why your group project is important 

2) What are your hypotheses?  

3) What will you collect? 

4) What are the next steps? 

Note: not all projects will work; if yours fails, please write a post-mortem that explains why.
