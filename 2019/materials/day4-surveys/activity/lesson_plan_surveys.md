# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2019
## Day 4, Surveys
## Prepared by Matt Salganik and Cambria Naslund

### Summary

In this activity, participants will work in groups to deploy an attitude survey to Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).  Then, they can use a data set that we have pre-collected from MTurk and weight the data to attempt to recover estimates from a high-quality probability sample.  At the end of the activity, they should de-identify their data, document it, and post it to the Summer Institute GitHub pages.

### Learning objectives

Designing and deploying a survey; familiarity with MTurk; strengths and weaknesses of non-probability samples; practice weighing non-probability samples; practice collecting data that can be released; practice de-identifying and releasing data

### Instruction preparation

To prepare for this activity you should: read the slides that I will use to introduce the activity; prepare one temporary MTurk account for each group that will be collecting data (if funding is available to support this data collection).

### Group formation

Form groups of about 4 - 5 people randomly.  If possible, each group should have one person with experience in surveys and one person with experience in MTurk.

### Rough schedule

60 minutes: Prepare and deploy surveys

Break for lunch while data is being collected

60 minutes: Analyze data

30 minutes: Archive data

15 minutes: Discuss activity
