# Guidelines for post-SICSS grants

For people at the 2019 Princeton SICSS location, we were able to offer some grants during SICSS and we hope to be able to offer larger grants afterwards. The purpose of this document is to describe the process of getting these post-SICSS grants.  As we said at SICSS, we hope to be able to give multiple grants of a few thousand of dollars, but we don't know the exact amounts yet because we are still trying to reconcile all of our outstanding charges.

## Timeline

We do not yet know exactly when the grants will be due, but we think that it will be around September 1, 2019.  That will give us time to close out all of our expenses and figure out how much money we will be able to award.  Once we have the applications, we should be able to make decisions in about a week.  All money needs to be out of our accounts by October 31, 2019 so that we can close out our grant.

## Proposal

Your proposal should include the following elements:

### Project title

### Applicants

Please include the affiliation (university and department); it is OK if your team changes some post-SICSS.

### Project description (about one page)

### Budget (about one paragraph and please include a table)

Please note that Russell Sage Foundation has a policy that all workers on micro-task platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) should be paid an hourly wage of $15.

### Financial logistics

Please describe how you think we should transfer the money to your group. Remember we are not a grant making organization so we can only cover expenses that we can put on our credit card and that provide a receipt. Examples of expenses that we can cover include: participant fees on Amazon Mechanical Turk or similar platforms and cloud computing credits. All money needs to be out of our accounts by October 31, 2019 so that we can close out our grant.

### Ethics and IRB issues

Please highlight any ethics and IRB issues raised by your research and describe how you plan to address them.

### Changes since SICSS

Please describe any changes to your project since SICSS. If the projects have not changed, that's fine too.

### Open science policy

Please reaffirm that you understand that recipients of the grant should make their data and code available to other researchers when their papers are published. We understand that data availability may be tricky in some situations.

### Reporting policy

Please reaffirm that you will send us a copy of your paper or other outputs so that we can link to them from the SICSS website.


## FAQ

#### Can we reuse parts of our proposal from SICSS?

Sure.

#### Can we include tables and figures?

Sure.

#### Is there a deadline for us to spend the money?

No. After we have paid for your research costs, there is no deadline for you to use the items.

#### Can we paid directly and get reimbursed?

Our preferred process is for us to pay directly. If that is not possible, we can explore other options.

#### Does this policy apply to "Team Debate"?

No. Team Debate is working on a different schedule given the nature of their project.

#### We have a question that is not covered here.  What should we do?

Send Matt and Chris a message on Slack.
