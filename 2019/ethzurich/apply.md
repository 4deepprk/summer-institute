# Eligibility


Participation is primarily geared towards advanced master's students, Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty within 7 years of their Doctorate. 

Professional applicants holding a master's or doctoral degree are also welcome but are not eligible for the addional funding.  

There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.

The tuition fees and meals during the institute will be covered for all participants.

(The funding situation regarding housing and travelling costs will be updated within the following month.)

About 20 participants will be invited.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study.
Social scientists with research-specific interest in programming and computational research, as well as advanced coders with research topics within social sciences are welcome.
We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions:

1. research and education in the area of computational social science
2. likelihood to benefit from participation,
3. likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants,
4. potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

Further, when making our evaluations, we will attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

# How to Apply

All applicants must submit the following documents to sicss.eth@gmail.com as a single, combined PDF file.

* a curriculum vitae

* applicants who are graduate students or postdoctoral researchers must submit at least one letter of recommendation from faculty advisors or professors familiar with their work in computational social science. Letters of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science;
* professional applicants must submit at least one letter of recommendation from their work supervisor 
* proof of English Proficiency (candidates are exempted from this restriction if 1) their native language is English 2) they have earned a degree of any level taught exclusively in English)

All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number).
