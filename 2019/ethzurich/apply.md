# Eligibility

We invite applications from advanced master’s students, Ph.D. students, and recent doctoral graduates (within 7 years of their doctorate), in academia or in industry. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.

While applicants from all backgrounds will be considered, we especially encourage applications from social scientists with a research-specific interest in programming and computation, as well as computer scientists or data scientists with an interest in social-science topics.

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions:

  *  research and education in the area of computational social science,
  *  likelihood to benefit from participation,
  *  likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants,
  *  potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

Further, when making our evaluations, we will attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

The program cohort will consist of about 20 participants. There are no fees to attend, and meals will be provided during the workshop.

In addition, we have available some funding to cover travel and housing, which will be provided based on need and merit. Postdocs, faculty, and members of industry are in general not eligible for the additional funding.

# How to Apply

All applicants must submit the following documents to [sicss.eth@gmail.com](mailto:sicss.eth@gmail.com) as a single, combined PDF file.

* a curriculum vitae;
* a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science;
* one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author;
* applicants who are graduate students or postdoctoral researchers must submit at least one letter of recommendation from faculty advisors or professors familiar with their work in computational social science. Letters of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science (please ask your recommender to send us their letter directly);
* professional applicants must submit at least one letter of recommendation from their work supervisor (please ask your recommender to send us their letter directly);
* proof of English Proficiency: TOEFL or Academic IELTS taken at most 2 years ago (candidates are exempted from this restriction if 1) their native language is English 2) they have earned a degree of any level taught exclusively in English and can provide a proof);
* if desired, application for the additional funding (housing and transportation): Please, explain the reasons why you need additional funding and provide an estimate of your traveling costs.

All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number).

​In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted before March 1st, 2019. Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by March 16th and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.
