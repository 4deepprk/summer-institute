# Eligibility

We welcome masters and PhD-level graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty. Applicants not based in NYC are welcome, though we will not be able to offer accomodations. However, we are able to offer participants a very reimbursement for travel and lodging to help offset travel costs.
