# Eligibility

SICSS Hunter-NYC is primarily intended for applied social science researchers and practitioners who want to deepen their knowledge of and experience in computational social science and its application to solving real-world social problems. We welcome masters and PhD-level graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty. Applicants not based in NYC are welcome, though we will not be able to offer accomodations. However, we are able to offer participants a modest reimbursement for travel and lodging to help offset travel costs. Participation is also open to other researchers and data scientists with a clear, demonstrated interest in computational social science. To help support parity of experience, we are limited to inviting up to 25 participants.
