# Eligibility

We invite applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Applications are open to all eligible individuals regardless of location, but **we cannot provide support for travel or lodging in Los Angeles**. SICSS-Los Angeles is committed to diversity and inclusion in computational social science, and we particularly encourage applicants from groups currently underrepresented in the field. We anticipate to admit roughly twenty participants.


Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. To support this preparatory work, participants will have access to a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the institute.
