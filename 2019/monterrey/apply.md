# Eligibility

We are inviting applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Meals will be provided during the workshop and we expect to invite about twenty to thirty participants. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience with coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language as well as attend a preparatory workshop in advance of the Institute. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

We expect to invite about twenty to thirty participants for this partner location. We invite applications not only from participants with a background in both computational methods and social science, but especially from those who seek to acquire new skills in either of these domains.

# How to Apply
Applicants should submit the following documents to oscar.mendezmd@uanl.edu.mx in a single PDF file: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science, (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. Applicants who are graduate students or postdoctoral researchers must submit two letters of recommendation from faculty advisors. All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number).

In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by **11:59 PM on March 29th, 2019**.
