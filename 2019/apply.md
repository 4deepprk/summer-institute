# Apply 

### Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D.  However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. About thirty participants will be invited.  

Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.  Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

### How to Apply

Our application system is not yet accepting materials.  But, once it is enabled, all applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science (especially as it relates to RSF research priorities such as behavioral economics, social inequality, future of work, and immigration), (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work we recommend that you include a paragraph talking about the contributions of each individual author.  Applicants who are graduate students or postdoctoral researchers must submit two letters of recommendation from faculty advisors. Letters of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science.  All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number). 

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.

**We will begin reviewing applications on Tuesday, February 19, 2019.**  Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration.  We will notify applicants solely through e-mail in mid-March, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. Inquiries can be sent to rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.
