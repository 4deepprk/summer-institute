# Eligibility

### Applicant Profile:
We invite applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. We expect to invite about twenty participants for this partner location, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. 

The aim of the RTI partner location is to build and expand a network of computational social scientists in the Research Triangle Park area. We invite applications not only from participants with a background in both computational methods and social science, but especially from those who seek to acquire new skills in either of these domains.

### Prerequisites:
Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Summer Institute, and participants with less coding experience will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Summer Institute. All participants will have access to DataCamp modules that introduce programming in R.

# How to Apply
To apply, please e-mail the following materials to <sicss@rti.org> as a single, combined PDF file.

- A curriculum vitae
- A statement (maximum 3 pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science.
- One writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. 
- Applicants who are graduate students must submit one letter of recommendation from a faculty advisor. Letters of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science. 

All applications must include an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number). In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by **11:59 PM PST on Friday, April 12th, 2019**. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail in early May and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

For any questions, please email <sicss@rti.org>.
