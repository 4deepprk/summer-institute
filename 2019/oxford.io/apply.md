# PURPOSE
The purpose of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS)  is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. SICSS is for both social scientists and data scientists.
In 2019, SICCS will be held from the evening of Sunday, June 16 to the morning of Saturday, June 29, 2019 at Princeton University. Because many more people are expected to apply than can be accommodated at Princeton, we are hosting a partner site at Oxford University (SICSS-Oxford). 


# DETAILS
SICSS-Oxford will run simultaneously to the the Institute at Princeton: June 16 to June 29. It is organized by former participants of the 2017 and 2018 SICSS workshops and will feature local speakers and live streams from Princeton. In the afternoons of the first week, participants at the Oxford location will also be able to work in teams to learn how to implement the material from the lectures. In the second week, participants will form teams to develop a research project related to computational social science.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping and digital trace data, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

# COST & ACCOMODATIONS
The Summer Institute in Computational Social Science is funded in part by grants from the Russell Sage Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. There are no registration fees for participating in SICSS-Oxford.
 
Participants are expected to attend both weeks of the institute. Meals will be provided for all participants at SICSS-Oxford during the event. Limited subsidies for accommodation and travel for those participants from outside Oxford may be available. 
 
# ELIGIBILITY
We are inviting applications from Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We are hoping to have wide participation from researchers across different departments, both from the social sciences and the computational/data sciences. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

# APPLICATION
See details for eligibility and apply by Friday, March 29, 2019. Note that this is a month after the main application deadline and after decisions about the main location are expected to have been made. If you have also applied to the Princeton location and have not yet heard from them at the time of your submission, please let us know in your cover letter. Applying to both locations will not affect your chances of being accepted to the Princeton location. However, we assume that if you are accepted there, you will not be joining us in Oxford.
