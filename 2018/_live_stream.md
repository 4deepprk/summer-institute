# Live Stream

For those unable to attend in person, we will be live-streaming each day from approximately 9:00am to 5:30pm ET. Group exercises and some of the visiting speaker's lectures will not be live-streamed.  No registrations will be required to watch the livestream.  We will post addition information about the livestream here once it is available. **Update: All videos have been posted to the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRV9I1xz2KwlgvLQ8OadKw).**
