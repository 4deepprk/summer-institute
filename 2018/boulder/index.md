From the morning of Monday, August 13 to the evening of Friday, August 17, 2018, University of Colorado Boulder will host a satellite of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). This satellite program is co-organized by Brian Keegan and Allie Morgan.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation will be open to all students, faculty and staff of universities in Colorado. We are supported by the Sloan Foundation, [Center to Advance Research and Training in the Social Sciences (CARTSS)](https://www.colorado.edu/cartss/), [Institute of Behavioral Science (IBS)](https://behavioralscience.colorado.edu), and [Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS)](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/).

### How to Apply
 
If you are interested in attending SICSS Boulder 2018, please complete [this application](https://goo.gl/forms/Xr8e6tbk5c5kfQm62). Space for this inaugural summer institute will be limited to approximately 30 people. Meals and beverages during the institute will be provided, but we unfortunately cannot provide funding for travel or accommodation. Accepted participants should already have or be willing to develop basic proficiency with computational reasoning/programming skills in Python and/or R before attending the program. We very strongly encourage applications from people traditionally under-represented in computing.

Kindly send any inquiries to [Brian Keegan](mailto:brian.keegan@colorado.edu) or [Allison Morgan](mailto:allison.morgan@colorado.edu). Applications will be due by June 1st.
