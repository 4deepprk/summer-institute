### How to Apply
 
If you are interested in attending SICSS Boulder 2018, please complete [this application](https://goo.gl/forms/Xr8e6tbk5c5kfQm62). Space for this inaugural summer institute will be limited to approximately 30 people. Meals and beverages during the institute will be provided, but we unfortunately cannot provide funding for travel or accommodation. Accepted participants should already have or be willing to develop basic proficiency with computational reasoning/programming skills in Python and/or R before attending the program. We very strongly encourage applications from people traditionally under-represented in computing.

Kindly send any inquiries to [Brian Keegan](mailto:brian.keegan@colorado.edu). Applications will be due by June 1st.
