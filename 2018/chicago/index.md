From Sunday, June 17 to Friday, June 29, 2018, the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](\summer-institute\) is sponsoring a Chicago partner site hosted at Northwestern University.  The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students and early career researchers in both social science (broadly conceived) and data science (broadly conceived).  Content will include live-streamed lectures from the main site at Duke University as well as guest speakers from local institutions.

Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, experimental design, non-probability sampling, agent based modeling, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. All materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Due to limited space, up to twenty participants will be invited. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.  To facilitate the planning process, **you must submit your [application materials](apply) by April 14th, 2018**.
