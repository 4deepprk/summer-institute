# Eligibility

SICSS-Seattle is primarily intended for academic researchers in the Seattle and Puget Sound area who want to deepen their engagement with computational social science. By this, we mean masters and PhD-level graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty at universities in the Seattle area. However, participation is also open to other researchers and data scientists with a clear, demonstrated interest in computational social science. For reasons of space, we are limited to inviting up to 25 participants.

Please note that **we cannot provide support for housing or for travel from outside Seattle**.
